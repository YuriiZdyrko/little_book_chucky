Chuck Norris was bitten by a cobra and after five days of excruciating pain... the cobra died.
He who laughs last, laughs best. He who laughs at Chuck Norris, it's definitely his last laugh. (In his book, The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book, Norris added under this fact: "Now that's funny. I love to laugh, as do most people." Most people are still unsure if he was joking.)
The easiest way to determine Chuck Norris's age is to cut him in half and count the rings. (Norris commented: "Three years ago, at the end of a Nightline interview, ABC host Bill Weir asked me my age and I told him 66. Then I added with a smile, 'I like to say I'm 39, with 27 years of experience.'")
Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs.
